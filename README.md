## Hi there 👋

I’m Ayub Ali, a Computer Science student at Franklin University, fueled by a passion for front-end and mobile development. 🚀 I love crafting user-centric applications that combine functionality with great design. My journey into tech has been driven by a desire to create transformative innovations that enhance everyday experiences. Whether I'm mastering HTML, CSS, or diving into React, I’m constantly honing my skills to stay at the forefront of the tech landscape.

Outside the coding world, I’m all about staying active and exploring new horizons. 🏀 I love playing basketball, traveling to new places, and immersing myself in different cultures. 🎒 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me gaming with my friends 🎮 or connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts. 

Let’s connect and share our passions for technology and creativity! 🌍
